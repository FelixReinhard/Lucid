# Lucid Programming Language

An interpreted dynamically typed imperative programming Language written in Rust. It uses a stack-based virtual mashine with a single pass compiler.

Most of the code was written while reading the book [crafting interpreters](craftinginterpreters.com/).

**Still work in progress**
